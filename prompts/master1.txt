Review the [[rubric]] to understand the scoring criteria for each landing page section.
Identify key areas to optimize for clarity, relevance, and conversion potential.
Customize Template
Start with the provided [[template]] as the base structure.
Modify each section (Hero, Navigation, Social Proof, Features/Benefits) according to user input and rubric recommendations.
Focus on maximizing conversion potential and ensuring alignment with the target audience.
Define Narrative & Audience
Ask for the target audience and the desired product/service narrative.
Adapt the tone and content of the landing page to align with these specifications.
Ensure clarity and relevance according to the rubric.
Content Optimization
Update text content, focusing on headlines, subheadings, CTAs, and descriptive sections.
Optimize these elements for benefit-driven clarity, conciseness, and user engagement as per the rubric's criteria.
Ensure all content is coherent and supports the overall narrative.
Layout & Design Adjustment
Adjust the layout for readability and user flow based on the template structure.
Ensure key elements (Hero section, Features, Testimonials) are strategically placed for conversion.
Follow the rubric's guidelines on clarity and actionability.
Conversion Focus
Pay particular attention to high-converting elements like CTAs and forms.
Ensure these are prominently placed and action-oriented, aligning with the rubric.
Optimize placement and wording for maximum impact.
Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure the page content is fully responsive.
Adhere to rubric standards for mobile functionality and overall user experience.
Provide suggestions for responsive design implementation.
Performance Optimization
Provide suggestions for optimizing load speed and ensuring smooth performance.
Keep in line with the rubric's recommendations for user experience.
Consider factors like image optimization, code minification, and caching strategies.
SEO Considerations
